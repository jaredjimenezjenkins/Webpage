## Experience

During my time at YWCA Northeastern Massachusetts, I managed youth ages 5-12 in engaging activities while behaving in a positive manner throughout various activities at Camp Y-Wood. I also directed groups of 15-20 kids from the Greater Lawrence/Haverhill MA area throughout Camp Y-Wood's 8-week program. I supported my assigned group to for my group to obtain positive experiences from camp. I evaluated the kids I was assigned to on a daily basis while establishing a precedent towards how to make a positive impact on life through myself and my leadership. 
As of 2024, I got promoted to be an educator for the YWCA Haverhill site. Here, I create monthly curriculums for my classroom with the goal of promoting brain engagement. With a diverse classroom of children ranging from ages 9 to 13, appealing to all ages as well as not creating overbearing activities is what makes such a position a valuable experience. Such activities within the curriculum ranged from subject based word scrambles to language learning. Student engagement has improved to 45% since being instated in my new role.
